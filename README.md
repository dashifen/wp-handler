# wp-handler
An object to define handlers for various WordPress action and filter hooks using protected methods.

## Provenance
I wrote this object to use at work with Engage, LLC in Alexandria, VA.  They've given me permission to make a copy of it and alter it for my own purposes, which is this repo.  Their copy, which is the initial commit into this repo, is their own and I think neither of us guarantee that, after some time passes, that they'll be interchangeable.
